## Ramtastic TODOs

- CLI "ram", something in the line of react-scripts
- CLI options:
  - add dependencies and scripts to existing project
  - create components
  - create containers (with selection from a list of existing components)
  - create actions (ramtastic doesn't need reducers)
  - translate HTML to snabbdom
- Parcel
- Usage documentation
